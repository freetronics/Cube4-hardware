The Cube is a USB powered, smart RGB LED Cube kit, with a serial command
interface for direct control and learning, an open source driver library
and an on-board Arduino compatible MCU running the whole show!

The Cube was designed using the open source KiCad schematic and pcb
design package: http://www.kicad.org

The schematic pages have been carefully laid out to make it easy to follow and
learn about a larger microcontroller based project design in operation.

Features:

 * Power and control by USB commands straight from your computer (Windows, Mac or Linux)
 * Expansion port connector for sensors, joysticks, game and interface add ons
 * Onboard ATmega32u4 MCU (Arduino Leonardo compatible)
 * USB interface for uploading new sketches and sending serial commands
 * Arduino driver library with example programs and animations at:
   https://github.com/freetronics/Cube4
 * Includes ZigBee/XBee headers so you can add a wireless module (not included)
 * Prototyping area with I2C, power and spare pins next to it
